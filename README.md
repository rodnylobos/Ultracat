# Ultracat

### GitHub Octocat hack.

This project is an unsolicitied version of the mascot. I used **Illustrator** and **Photoshop** to make it.

## Just for fun

The proposal was to make part of the **GitHub Octodex** gallery.

I tried to contact somebody at GitHub, but they told me that it was just for the GitHub inner circle.


Anyways, I had fun!
