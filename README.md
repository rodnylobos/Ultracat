# Ultracat

### GitHub Octocat hack.

This project is an unsolicitied version of the mascot. 
To make it I used **Adobe Illustrator** and **Adobe Photoshop**.

## Just for fun

The proposal was to make part of the **GitHub Octodex** gallery.
I tried to contact the guys at GitHub, but they told me that it was just for the GitHub staff.

Anyways, I had fun!
